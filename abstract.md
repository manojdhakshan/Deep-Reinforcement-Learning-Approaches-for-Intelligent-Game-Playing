# Deep-Reinforcement-Learning-Approaches-for-Intelligent-Game-Playing

In Reinforcement Learning, a category of machine learning, learning is based on evaluative feedbacks without any supervised signals. The paper presents work aimed to understand the deep reinforcement learning approaches to creating such intelligent agents, by reproducing existing research and comparing their results. The project uses google dino game, in which the agent will learn control policies using deep reinforcement learning approaches to achieve a high score. The project explores two deep reinforcement learning approaches, Asynchronous Advantage actor-critic and Deep Q-Learning, both proposed by the DeepMind team, to train intelligent agents that can interact with an environment with automatic feature engineering thus requiring minimal domain knowledge.
